				core concepts. The lesson has been specially designed with examples and coding exercises that enforces what you
				have learned. At the end of each session, we are going to build a simple Python project
				together.

            	Python is one of the most popular programming languages, and every
				day people use it to do cool things like automation in
				their daily lives, artificial intelligence, as well as, building applications and
				websites.

            	To begin, why learn to program? Steve Jobs once said, "Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer... because it teaches
				you how to think." Computer programming is an enormously flexible tool that you can use to do amazing things that are otherwise either manual
				and laborsome or are just impossible. In fact, software is running your life. What if you learn and start running these programs according to
				your will?

            	For example, you can write a program that can automatically respond to every new text
				message on your phone. To a message like "Hi" or "Hey," the program can read
				through the message to detect some pre-defined keywords like "Hi" and "Hey," and send an
				automatic response

            	Rewind a little and see what made

            	Well, now that you are familiar with programming in a nutshell, and
				why you should learn to program. You are probably asking, "Out of
				all the programming languages readily available to learn, so why learn Python?"

            	Python, named after the British comedy group Monty Python, is a high-level, interpreted, interactive, and object-oriented programming language. According
				to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey last year, Python is the 4th most popular language to date. Furthermore, Python
				is a simple language to read, learn, and write! It is also a free, accessible, versatile, and powerful language.

            	Let's also take a quick look at how some big tech companies are using the language. Google is a company that has used Python from the start, and it has gained a place as one of the tech giant's main server-side languages alongside C++, Java, and Golang. Instagram
				likes Python for its simplicity. The service is known for running. Even Spotify puts the language to use in its data analysis and back-end services so that they can perform millions of analysis a day to give recommendations to their users, and Python helps with that, they need
				something that's simple but also works well. Last but not least, Reddit uses Python as its software backbone, the social discussion platform, which had 542 million visitors every month across 2017 — which is the fourth most visited website in the U.S. and seventh-most visited in the world.

            <Text>
            	Multiparadigm: It lets you write

				, , and  styles.
            <Text>
            <Text>
            	Dynamically typed: It checks 
				types at runtime, so you
				don't need to declare them
				explicitly.
            <Text>
            <Text>
            	Strongly typed: It won't

            	There's a lot more to learn about Python. But by now, you should have a better idea of why Python is so popular and why
				you should consider learning to program with it. So let's start with learning the syntax of Python. The Python  is clear, concise, and focused
				on readability. Readability is arguably one of the more attractive features of the language itself. It makes Python ideal for people who are learning to
				program.

            	Before we actually start learning Python, I want to give a disclaimer, it's okay if your code does
				not work, or if you don't understand why it is not behaving to your expected behaviour. It happens
				to everyone, even to the most experienced Python developers. If you are stuck, do not hesitate to join
