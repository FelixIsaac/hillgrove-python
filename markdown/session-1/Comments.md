# Python Comments

Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

```py
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```

What are Python comments used for?

- To explain Python code.
- Tto make the code more readable.
- To prevent execution when testing code.

A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

```py
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```
